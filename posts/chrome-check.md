I've developed a unique application called **"Chroma Check"**. This application uses the power of virtual reality (VR) to provide a color blindness assessment based on the **Ishihara test**, a well-known method for diagnosing color blindness. 

The application is built using **A-Frame**, a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. The VR environment created by Chroma Check provides an immersive experience that helps in accurately assessing color blindness. The Ishihara test, traditionally done with printed cards, is transformed into an engaging VR experience. This allows individuals to self-detect color blindness without the need for specialized equipment or clinic visits. So, with Chroma Check, discovering your true colors is just a VR experience away!
