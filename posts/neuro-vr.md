I've created an application called **"Neuro VR"**. This application allows users to explore the human brain in a unique and immersive way using WebXR, a technology that combines web and virtual reality. 

The application is built using **A-Frame**, a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. With Neuro VR, users can delve into the depths of the brain, from the cerebral cortex to the medulla oblongata. This provides a unique opportunity to learn about the brain's structure and functions in an engaging and interactive way. So, with Neuro VR, exploring the human brain is just a VR experience away!
