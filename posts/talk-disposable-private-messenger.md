I've developed an application called **"Talk - Disposable Private Messenger"**. It's a decentralized platform that provides end-to-end encryption, ensuring that your conversations are private and secure. 

The application uses **Socket.IO**, a JavaScript library for real-time web applications, to enable real-time messaging. The server-side is built with **Express**, a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. For the user interface, I used **Pug**, a high-performance template engine. The unique feature of this application is that it ensures user conversations vanish upon disconnection, providing an extra layer of privacy. So, with Talk, you can have private conversations without worrying about your messages being stored or tracked.
